# My-Neural-Network

A Neural Network implementation from scratch using only NumPy, designed with a PyTorch-like architecture.

## Overview

This project implements various neural network components and architectures using pure NumPy, without relying on deep learning frameworks. The implementation follows a modular design similar to PyTorch's structure.

## Features

- Pure NumPy implementation
- PyTorch-like layer architecture
- Modular design with base classes for layers and networks
- Implementations include:
  - Linear layers with customizable activations
  - Backpropagation
  - Common loss functions (MSE)

## Project Structure

- [`lib.py`](lib.py): Core functionality, base classes and utility functions
- [`LinearLayer.py`](LinearLayer.py): Implementation of linear/fully connected layer
- [`tutorial/`](tutorial/): Jupyter notebooks with examples and tutorials

## Goals

- Educational resource for understanding neural networks
- Implementation of various network architectures from scratch
- Demonstration of backpropagation and gradient descent
- Minimal dependencies (NumPy only)

## Getting Started

The project requires only NumPy. Check the tutorial notebooks for examples of creating and training networks.
